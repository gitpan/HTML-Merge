                        INSTALL

If you are on a system where you can run the Makefile.PL and use make,
then the package can be installed using the normal MakeMaker process,
that is

  gunzip HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz
  tar xvf HTML-Merge-*.*
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note: on Linux and FreeBSD this can be shortened to:

  tar zxvf HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

On many other systems this could be written as:
  gzip -d -c HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

At this stage HTML::Merge modules are installed for system wide use.
You can read the man pages for HTML::Merge and HTML::Merge:Tags for
more information.

Now as you want to set you own application use the script mergecreateinstance.

run:
  mergecreateinstance 

For first time users we reccomand to install samples and to use NONE option
when mergecreateinstance prompt you for security.

It is recommended for first time to give mergecreateinstance
a simple httpd.conf so that it will work for you, and later try it on 
a more complicated environment. 

Note: mergecreateinstance works better if the module Term::ReadKey::Gnu
is installed.
