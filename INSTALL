----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this document you can find information on how to install HTML::Merge
and create instances. Instances are the merge application.
You will need to create an instance for every web directory (URL)
that you want to use merge.


1. LINUX and UNIX like systems:
=====================================================================
If you are on a system where you can run the Makefile.PL and use make,
then the package can be installed using the normal MakeMaker process,
that is

  gunzip HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz
  tar xvf HTML-Merge-*.*
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note: on Linux and FreeBSD this can be shortened to:

  tar zxvf HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

On many other systems this could be written as:
  gzip -d -c HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

At this stage HTML::Merge modules are installed for system wide use.
You can read the man pages for HTML::Merge and HTML::Merge:Tags for
more information.

In the next stage you will create your instances (Please 
read chapter 3).

2. WINDOWS like systems :
==========================================================
Open the tar file to an empty directory (e.g C:\MERGE).

perl mergecreateinstance.PL
perl merge.cgi.PL

Now you will be able to create your instance by typing 
perl mergecreateinstance. (Please read chapter 3).

Windows user can create instances ONLY in the "local" mode, 
from the directory where mergecreateinstance is. 

3. After Install - Run merge-create instance
==========================================================
Now as you want to set you own application use the script mergecreateinstance.

run:
  mergecreateinstance 
(on Windows type "perl mergecreateinstance").

For first time users we recommend to install samples and to use NONE option
when mergecreateinstance prompt you for security.

It is recommended for first time to give mergecreateinstance
a simple httpd.conf so that it will work for you, and later try it on 
a more complicated environment. 

4. Instance install for non Apache web-server users
=========================================================
If you are using non apache web server, do the following.
1. Create a script web directory (like cgi-bin) from which you have 
rights to run CGI application.
2. create merge instance using merge-create instance to that directory.
3. set rights to the directory.
