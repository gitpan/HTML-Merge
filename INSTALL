If you are on a system where you can run the Makefile.PL and use make,
then the package can be installed using the normal MakeMaker process,
that is

  gunzip HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz
  tar xvf HTML-Merge-*.*
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note: on Linux and FreeBSD this can be shortened to:

  tar zxvf HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

On many other systems this could be written as:
  gzip -d -c HTML-Merge-*.*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd HTML-Merge-*.*
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

After install is completed, to actually create an application instance
run:
  mergecreateinstance 

Note: mergecreateinstance works better if the module Term::ReadKey::Gnu
is installed.
