GUEST Demo application
=-==-====-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==
This is a demo guest book application we have on our site. 

Please note it was developed for HTML::Merge version 1,
 where many features we have today where not available.

For that reason a lot of use of <$RPERL> that we wouldn't
need today.

I've added the lines in merge.conf you should
check and modify. You will have to connect
your SQL database having the proper settings 
in merge.conf. 

mergecreateinstance can help you to set 
the database for the demo application.

you have MySQL  loadme.sql that contains the data 
for the demo application.

Type http://YourServer.com/cgi-bin/merge.pl?template=tableframe.html
to run the demo.

As I belive you want the demo to be as small
as possible I use js, css and gif file from www.raz.co.il.
The demo is not fully functional as i didn't want to
change some javascript functions on our web server.

You can run the demo with no internet connection but
it will not be as nice :( 

Enjoy
