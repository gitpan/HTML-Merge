NAME
    HTML::Merge - Embedded HTML/SQL/Perl system.

INSTALLATION
    After installing the package, activate mergecreateinstance to create an
    instance in your cgi-bin (or mod_perl) directory. Follow the directions
    you get from mergecreateinstance in order to configure your web server.

    You must edit the merge.conf created for you.

SYNOPSIS
            <HTML>
            <$RQ.'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id=<$RVAR.cust_id>'>
            <$RLOOP>
                    <$RSQL.name> owes <$RSQL.debt><BR>
            </$RLOOP>
            <A HREF="/cgi-bin/merge.pl?template=main_menu.html">
            </HTML>

DESCRIPTION
    Merge is an embedded HTML/Perl/SQL tool for creating dynamic web
    content. merge.pl compiles HTML with embeded Perl to Perl CGI programs
    and run them.

    All Merge pages are referred to by
    cgi-bin-dir/merge.pl?template=file.html

    (Important: file.html is a HTML template that located in a directory you
    choose and name it on the merge.conf file. Notice for better security,
    the web server must not be able to display the templates dirctory).
    although on CGI mode you can define merge.pl as an handler with the
    Action directive in Apache.

    Using merge.pl under Apache::Registry will utilize Perl's built-in
    caching to cache pages using the do command.

    Merge uses a configuration file to retrieve information about paths,
    database connectivity and debugging. It has an embedded debugging tool
    and on-line configuration. To turn that option on, set DEVELOPMENT to 1
    in the configuration file. Don't forget to set it off before deployment.

    Configuration can be changed during development using the toolkit
    menues, toolkit menues apear as popup windows on your web browser when
    you open a URL of mrege.pl.

    Alternate configuration files can appear in /etc/merge.conf and
    $HOME/.merge.

    As described in the INSTALL document you must set your web server for
    each appliaction and copy (or create) links to merge.pl and PUBLIC files
    and templates and create system database tables. If you are using a UNIX
    system you can use mergecreateinstance that will do thoes tasks for you.

FILES
