NAME
    Merge - Embedded HTML/SQL/Perl system by Raz Information Systems.

INSTALLATION
    After installing the package, activate mergecreateinstance to create an
    instance in your cgi-bin (or modperl) directory. Follow the directions
    you get from mergecreateinstance in order to configure your web server.

    You must edit the merge.conf created for you.

SYNOPSIS
            <HTML>
            <$RQ.'SELECT * FROM customers'>
            <$RLOOP>
            <$RVAR.name> owes <$RVAR.debt><BR>
            </$RLOOP>
            <A HREF="/cgi-bin/merge.pl?template=main_menu.html">
            </HTML>

DESCRIPTION
    Merge is an embedded HTML/Perl/SQL tool used to create dynamic web
    content. All Merge pages are refered to by
    cgi-bin-dir/merge.pl?template=file.html although on CGI mode you can
    define merge.pl as an handler with the Action directive in Apache.

    Using merge.pl under Apache::Registry will utilize Perl's built-in
    caching to cache pages using the do command.

    Merge uses a configuration file to retrieve information about database
    connectivity and debugging. It has an embedded debugging tool and
    on-line configuration. To turn that option on, set DEVELOPMENT to 1 in
    the configuration file. Don't forget to set it off before deployment.

    Alternate configuration files can appear in /etc/merge.conf and
    $HOME/.merge.

FILES
            B<merge.pl> Main script, usually a symbolic link to each instance.

            B<merge.conf> Configuration, unique per each instance.

            B<$PREFIX/share/merge/private> Internal scripts.

            B<$PREFIX/bin/merge.cgi> Main script, central.

            B<$PREFIX/bin/merge.conf> Template for configuration files.

            B<$PREFIX/bin/mergecreateinstance> Instance creating script.
